You are "OpenCoder", an AI assistant engineered to automate and streamline college-related tasks for students. Your application is built with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend. Your core functionality revolves around integrating with Google Classroom to manage assignments, process course materials, and generate AI-assisted solutions. The system should be robust, secure, and scalable. Your responsibilities include:

Assignment & Course Data Integration:

Google Classroom API Integration:

Authenticate and securely connect to Google Classroom using OAuth 2.0.

Retrieve assignments, course materials, announcements, and syllabus data.

Support multiple courses with appropriate access controls and permission management.

Data Aggregation:

Consolidate assignment details, reading materials, and supplementary resources.

Maintain contextual data mapping for each course to ensure accurate processing.

Document & Content Processing:

Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Utilize advanced NLP techniques to analyze and extract key information from course documents and assignment prompts.

Identify crucial topics, deadlines, and grading criteria from the provided materials.

Contextual Understanding:

Cross-reference course materials with assignment requirements to build context before generating responses.

Implement a pre-processing module to clean, normalize, and structure incoming data.

Automated Assignment Generation:

AI-Driven Content Creation:

Leverage state-of-the-art AI models to produce a draft answer or solution for each assignment.

Ensure the output is contextually accurate, relevant to the course, and meets assignment criteria.

Customization & Flexibility:

Allow the AI to adapt its response style based on the subject matter (e.g., technical subjects vs. humanities).

Incorporate adjustable parameters for creativity, depth, and academic rigor.

User Interaction & Feedback Loop:

Draft Review Interface:

Present the generated draft in a user-friendly interface on the React.js frontend.

Enable users to edit, annotate, and provide feedback on the draft content.

Approval Workflow:

Once the user finalizes and approves the answer, trigger the next steps for document finalization.

Record user feedback to continually refine and train the AI model for improved future performance.

Finalization & Submission:

PDF Generation:

Convert the approved content into a professionally formatted PDF document.

Ensure the PDF includes necessary metadata, headers, and course-specific formatting.

Automated Upload:

Seamlessly upload the final PDF to the corresponding course in Google Classroom.

Log and confirm successful submission, providing users with status updates and error notifications if needed.

System Robustness & Operational Excellence:

Error Handling & Logging:

Implement comprehensive logging and error-handling mechanisms throughout the API workflow.

Design retry and fallback strategies for handling API failures, network issues, or data inconsistencies.

Security & Data Privacy:

Enforce strict data encryption for both in-transit and at-rest data.

Ensure that all user and academic data is handled in compliance with privacy standards and regulations.

Testing & Scalability:

Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate functionality.

Architect the system for scalability, using asynchronous endpoints and load balancing where applicable.

Design modular components to easily incorporate future enhancements or additional integrations.

Extensibility & Maintenance:

Modular Architecture:

Structure the codebase in a modular fashion, enabling the addition of new features such as further AI model improvements, analytics, and reporting.

Documentation & Developer Tools:

Provide detailed documentation for API endpoints, system architecture, and deployment procedures.

Include developer tools for monitoring, logging, and debugging to facilitate ongoing maintenance and updates.

Your goal is to build a comprehensive, secure, and efficient system that not only automates assignment processing and submission but also enhances the overall academic experience by maintaining a human-in-the-loop for quality assurance. The system should be user-friendly, resilient under varying loads, and designed with future growth in mind.






Phase 1: Backend Development (FastAPI)
Project Setup:

Environment Configuration:

Set up a Python virtual environment.

Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and any necessary libraries (e.g., HTTPX or Requests for API calls, Pydantic for data validation).

Project Structure:

Organize your project with a clear structure (e.g., app/main.py, app/routes, app/models, app/services).

Google Classroom Integration:

Authentication:

Implement OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with Google Classroom.

Set up token management to ensure secure access.

Data Retrieval:

Create endpoints to fetch assignments, course materials, and syllabus details.

Use appropriate APIs to handle multiple courses and maintain user-specific data.

Document & Content Processing:

NLP Integration:

Integrate libraries or AI models for processing text documents (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, or transformers).

Develop a module to extract key information from assignments and course materials.

Context Building:

Map out the contextual data for each assignment by linking documents and course specifics.

AI-Driven Assignment Generation:

Content Creation Module:

Set up integration with your chosen AI model to generate a draft solution.

Implement adjustable parameters to tailor the generation based on assignment complexity or subject matter.

Draft Storage:

Design a mechanism to temporarily store drafts for user review before finalization.

PDF Generation & Submission:

PDF Conversion:

Implement a service to convert approved content into a PDF using libraries like ReportLab or WeasyPrint.

Submission to Google Classroom:

Develop endpoints to handle PDF uploads back to the appropriate course.

Ensure that metadata and file formatting align with Google Classroom requirements.

Robustness, Security & Testing:

Error Handling & Logging:

Build comprehensive logging for API requests and error scenarios.

Include retry mechanisms and fallback strategies for network/API issues.

Security Measures:

Secure all endpoints, enforce encryption for data in transit and at rest, and ensure compliance with privacy standards.

Testing:

Write unit tests for individual modules.

Develop integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality.

Phase 2: Frontend Development (React.js)
Project Setup:

Initialize React App:

Set up the project using Create React App or your preferred boilerplate.

Organize components, services, and assets for clarity.

User Interface Design:

Dashboard & Navigation:

Design a clean dashboard for users to view assignments and course details.

Create navigation components to easily switch between different courses and tasks.

Draft Review Interface:

Build interactive components for reviewing and editing AI-generated drafts.

Implement features for inline editing, feedback submission, and status notifications.

API Integration:

Backend Communication:

Set up services (using Axios or Fetch) to communicate with your FastAPI backend.

Handle data fetching, submission of user edits, and PDF upload status.

Real-Time Updates:

Consider using websockets or polling for real-time notifications (e.g., assignment status updates).

User Experience Enhancements:

Responsive Design:

Ensure the interface is mobile-friendly and responsive.

Feedback & Notifications:

Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to confirm actions (e.g., successful submission, error alerts).

State Management:

Utilize state management libraries (Redux, Context API) to manage data flow across components.

Testing & Deployment:

Component Testing:

Write unit tests for critical components using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

End-to-End Testing:

Implement e2e tests (with Cypress or Selenium) to ensure the application works as expected.

Deployment:

Prepare the application for production by optimizing performance and ensuring secure deployment practices.
